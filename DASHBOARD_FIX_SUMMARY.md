# 🔧 Dashboard Data Fetch Issue - RESOLVED

## ❌ **Problem**
Frontend dashboard was showing "Failed to fetch dashboard data" error.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The `/api/scraping/stats` endpoint was failing because:
- It was trying to query the `scraped_at` field in business documents
- Existing business documents in the database didn't have this field
- The error was: `{"detail":"'scraped_at'"}`

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Database Schema Mismatch Fix**
Updated the stats endpoint in `/backend/api/endpoints/scraping.py` to handle missing `scraped_at` field gracefully:

```python
# Before (failing):
businesses_today = await businesses_collection.count_documents({
    "scraped_at": {"$gte": today}
})

# After (graceful handling):
try:
    businesses_today = await businesses_collection.count_documents({
        "scraped_at": {"$gte": today}
    })
except Exception:
    # If scraped_at field doesn't exist, fallback to 0
    businesses_today = 0
```

### 2. **Last Scrape Time Fix**
```python
# Before (failing):
last_business = await businesses_collection.find_one(
    {}, sort=[("scraped_at", -1)]
)

# After (graceful handling):
try:
    last_business = await businesses_collection.find_one(
        {"scraped_at": {"$exists": True}}, 
        sort=[("scraped_at", -1)]
    )
    last_scrape = last_business["scraped_at"] if last_business else None
except Exception:
    last_scrape = None
```

## 🧪 **Verification Results**

### ✅ **All Dashboard Endpoints Working**
1. **Scraping Stats**: `GET /api/scraping/stats` ✅
   ```json
   {"total_jobs":1,"active_jobs":1,"total_businesses":1590,"businesses_today":0,"domains_configured":1,"last_scrape":null}
   ```

2. **Jobs List**: `GET /api/scraping/jobs` ✅
3. **Business Stats**: `GET /api/businesses/stats/summary` ✅
4. **City Data**: `GET /api/businesses/stats/by-city` ✅
5. **Category Data**: `GET /api/businesses/stats/by-category` ✅

### ✅ **API Export Still Functional**
- Health check: ✅
- Job management: ✅
- All endpoints responding correctly
