# Quick Deployment Fix for Nginx Issues

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Summary:**
Both frontend and backend are showing nginx default pages instead of the expected applications.

## ðŸ”§ **Immediate Fix Strategy:**

### **Option 1: Use Single Container Approach (Recommended)**
Since Coolify seems to be having issues with the multi-container setup, let's switch to the single-container approach that bundles everything together.

### **Option 2: Debug Current Multi-Container Setup**
Check what's actually running in the containers and fix the nginx configuration.

## ðŸš€ **Quick Fix: Switch to Single Container**

Update your Coolify configuration:
1. **Build Pack:** `Dockerfile`
2. **Dockerfile:** `Dockerfile.single` (instead of docker-compose.yaml)
3. **Port:** `80`

This will use our single-container setup that includes:
- âœ… MongoDB connection to your external database
- âœ… Backend FastAPI on port 8000
- âœ… Frontend React served by nginx on port 80
- âœ… Nginx proxy routing `/api/*` to backend
- âœ… All services managed by supervisor

## ðŸ“‹ **Alternative: Debug Current Setup**

If you want to keep the multi-container approach, we need to:
1. Check what's actually running in the containers
2. Verify the nginx configuration is being applied
3. Ensure React build files are in the right location
4. Verify backend FastAPI is starting properly

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommendation:**

**Switch to single container approach** for now since it's more reliable and easier to debug. Once working, we can optimize back to multi-container if needed.

Would you like me to help you switch to the single-container approach or debug the current setup?
